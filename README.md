# Improve_Python
This is a repository that can show people how to use python in a more programming method instead of using jupyter notebooks all the times. 

## Project Idea
Create a playoff tournament using exclusively from CLI, that also keeps track of regular season records. 

### Requirements for project complettion
- [x] Store teams
- [x] Init teams in playoffs
- [x] Read scores from CLI
- [x] Store scores (technically correct though we don't store info into the class for playoff W's... this could be removed ???) 
- [x] Determine who won and who lost
- [x] Progress to next stage of playoffs


## Remaining to-do's for the project part 1. 
- Make python code modular and non-modular to show why we like modular.
- Test some optimizations (my code bad ?)
